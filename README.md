# Python-beetle

Hello! This project was made for a GCSE Computer Science assignment, which involved making a Python version of [Beetle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetle_%28game%29#:~:text=Beetle%20is%20a%20British%20party,sometimes%20called%20Cootie%20or%20Bugs.) that was between the human player and the computer.
Though it may **not be completely accurate**, it should cover the gist of the original game.

## Technical details

- Written using Python 3.10.5
- Utilizes the Turtle graphics library to create a visual graphic of the player or computer's beetle.
- `termcolor` library used to make console text a certain colour.
